Tour is an app that is trying to make exploring new cities easier. With this project I am trying to showcase my skills and ability to code. 

# Usage of app

On main screen you can see list where you can find available cities. When clicking on one of the cells it will take you to next screen where you can find tours. Clicking on the image will flip to text view with brief info about city. Choosing one of tours will move you to next screen with map and annotations. In this screen you can read some info about tour. 


# Keep in mind

App is not fully working. Still there is a lot to do. Master has current working version with dummy data. 

# Things to do 

∆ Fix some screen glitching 

∆ Add access to database(Firebase)

∆ Add geofencing 

∆ Some design improvements

∆ Start naviagtion with buttom  

∆ Fix some memory leaks
