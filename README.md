Tour is an app that is trying to make exploring new cities easier. With this project I am trying to showcase my skills and ability to code. 

# Usage of app

On main screen you can see cities where you can find available cities. When clicking on one of the cells it will take you to next screen where you can find tours. Clicking on image of top will flip to to text view with brief info about city. Choosing one of tours will move you to next screen with map and annotations. In this screen you can read some info about tour. 


# Things to do
